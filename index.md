This is a blog that contains learning notes for the technologies related to LLM performance enhancement (at least for now).

Before skimming through my posts, I suggest you to read [this article](https://medium.com/@researchgraph/brief-introduction-to-the-history-of-large-language-models-llms-3c2efa517112) to have some understanding of the history of NLP and LLMs.

My blog may not cover everything, but I can assure you that it covers the topics relevant to my internship (Sep ~ Dec 2024) at [DSLab](https://sites.google.com/site/datasciencelaboratory).

More to come soon(?)
