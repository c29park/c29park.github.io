This is a blog that contains learning notes for the technologies related to LLM performance enhancement (at least for now).

Though it may not cover everything, I can assure you that it does cover the topics relevant to my internship (Sep ~ Dec 2024) at [DSLab](https://sites.google.com/site/datasciencelaboratory).

More to come soon(?)
