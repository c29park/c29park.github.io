## CAG, GraphRAG, and KAG

Ordinary RAG (vector search -> stuff passages into context) is great for many tasks, but it struggles with multi-hop reasoning, strict logic like time or numbers, and precise entity relationships. 
Below I summarize the first proposal or seminal sources for four adjacent ideas: 
Knowledge Graphs (KGs), KAG (Knowledge-Augmented Generation), GraphRAG, and CAG (Cache-Augmented Generation). 
I will also explain when each makes sense compared to the basic RAG.
