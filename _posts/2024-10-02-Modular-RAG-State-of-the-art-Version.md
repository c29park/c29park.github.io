Basic RAG, often referred to as naive RAG, is a slightly outdated version. Not only is the pipeline too simple, but it also often struggles to understand complex user queries, retrieves irrelevant chunks, and ultimately result in hallucinated responses. Attempting to solve these issues, the state of the art version of RAG called Modular RAG incorporates various modules that can be modified and applied to enhance RAG performance. Langchain defines the modules as follows:
+ Query Translation 
+ Routing
+ Query Structuring
+ Indexing
+ Retrieval
+ Generation

#### Query Translation

The first module for modular RAG is Query Translation. This module transforms the query so that better retreival of documents can be done. This might be non-intuitive just yet, but as we go through a few examples of query translation techniques. Before we go through them, we ought to know how a query can be transformed.
